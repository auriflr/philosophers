# PHILOSOPHERS: a project about multithreading

## Description
Note for self: it's like they're sitting in a circle, philo1 sits next to philoN,

### arguments
Args will be:
av[1] = number of philosophers and forks
av[2] = *time_to_die*  (milliseconds) -> if a philosopher has not started eating within this time since their
last meal or start of the simulation, they die.
av[3] = *time_to_eat* (milliseconds) -> the time it takes a philosopher to eat. While they eat, they hold TWO forks.
av[4] = *time_to_sleep* (milliseconds) -> the time a philosopher spends sleeping.
There is a last, optional argument:
av[5] = *number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat* -> if all philosophers have eaten at least as much as n, the simulation stops. 
If this last argument is not included, the simulation stops when the philosopher dies.
